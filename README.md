<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 <img src="images/spr.jpg" alt="Logo" width="600" height="200">

This application is intended to be used with a custom design casing that houses a laser, several mirrors and lenses, a prism, (some other shit that Iâ€™m too lazy to figure out right now), a microcontroller unit with an embedded camera, and finally a power supply unit that uses either an internal battery or AC adaptor.

Here is a list of planned features for the software:
* Binary control of the laser diode to preform excitation
* Management of data capture rate and pixel density
* View battery life of the internal LiPo battery
* View, store, and manipulate captured data from current or past experiments
* There's gonan be some other stuff too, just you wait ... I just gotta think of them

I need coffee.

A list of commonly used resources such as plugins and addons that I found helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
